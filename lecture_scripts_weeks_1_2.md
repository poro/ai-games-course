**Week 1 Foundation**

### [0:00-2:00] Introduction & Objectives

**[ON SCREEN: Course title slide with engaging game montage]**

**NARRATOR**: Welcome to "AI & Games: Creating Games with Artificial Intelligence Tools." I'm excited to take you on a journey that will fundamentally change how you think about game development. 

**[ON SCREEN: Transition to instructor speaking directly to camera]**

Over the next eight weeks, you'll discover how artificial intelligence is democratizing game creation, making it possible for anyone with creativity and vision to build compelling games—regardless of their technical background.

**[ON SCREEN: Learning objectives slide]**

By the end of today's lecture, you'll understand the current landscape of AI in game development, experience creating your first AI-generated game, and have a clear roadmap for the tools and techniques we'll explore throughout this course.

**[ON SCREEN: Transition to game development timeline graphic]**

Let's start with a question: What if I told you that the game industry is experiencing its most significant transformation since the shift from 2D to 3D graphics? That transformation is happening right now, and it's powered by artificial intelligence.

### [2:00-8:00] The Current AI Gaming Landscape

**[ON SCREEN: Split screen showing traditional vs AI-assisted development]**

**NARRATOR**: For decades, game development has been the domain of large studios with massive budgets and specialized teams. A typical AAA game requires artists, programmers, designers, musicians, writers, and dozens of other specialists working for years to create a single title.

**[ON SCREEN: Statistics showing game development costs and team sizes]**

But AI is changing this equation dramatically. Today, a single developer can generate professional-quality art, compose original music, write compelling narratives, and even code complex game mechanics—all with the assistance of artificial intelligence.

**[ON SCREEN: Montage of AI-generated game assets]**

Let me show you what's possible. Here's a character model generated in under 30 seconds using Meshy AI. This soundtrack was composed by Suno.ai in just two minutes. And this entire game world was created using Bitmagic's AI platform in less than an hour.

**[ON SCREEN: Comparison chart of development times: Traditional vs AI-assisted]**

The numbers are staggering. What once took weeks or months can now be accomplished in hours or days. But here's the crucial point—this isn't about replacing human creativity. It's about amplifying it.

**[ON SCREEN: Diagram showing AI as creative partner]**

Think of AI as the ultimate creative partner: one that never gets tired, can work in any art style, speaks every programming language, and can generate thousands of variations of your ideas in seconds. The human developer remains the creative director, the visionary who guides and curates the AI's output.

### [8:00-14:00] AI-Native vs AI-Enhanced Development

**[ON SCREEN: Two-column comparison layout]**

**NARRATOR**: As we explore AI in game development, it's important to understand two distinct approaches: AI-native platforms and AI-enhanced traditional development.

**[ON SCREEN: Rosebud AI interface demonstration]**

AI-native platforms like Rosebud AI and Bitmagic are designed from the ground up for AI-assisted creation. You describe your game concept in natural language, and the platform generates playable prototypes. These tools are incredibly powerful for rapid prototyping and learning.

**[ON SCREEN: Live demonstration of creating a simple game in Rosebud AI]**

Watch this: I'm going to create a simple platformer game right now. I'll type "Create a 2D platformer with a robot character who collects energy crystals while avoiding laser obstacles." 

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Real-time game creation process]**

And there we have it—a playable game in under three minutes. The AI generated the character sprites, level design, game mechanics, and even basic sound effects. This is the power of AI-native development.

**[ON SCREEN: Unity and Unreal Engine logos with AI integration graphics]**

On the other hand, AI-enhanced development takes traditional game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine and adds AI capabilities. Unity's new AI suite includes tools for generating textures, sprites, and even code. Unreal Engine has plugins like Ludus AI that provide similar functionality.

**[ON SCREEN: Workflow diagram showing traditional engine + AI tools]**

This approach gives you more control and flexibility but requires more technical knowledge. You're working with professional-grade tools used by major studios, but with AI assistance to accelerate your workflow.

### [14:00-19:00] Course Tools and Platforms Overview

**[ON SCREEN: Grid layout of all course tools with logos]**

**NARRATOR**: Throughout this course, we'll explore both approaches using a carefully selected toolkit that balances accessibility, power, and cost-effectiveness.

**[ON SCREEN: Highlight each tool as mentioned]**

For AI-native development, we'll use Rosebud AI for its educational focus and Bitmagic for its advanced 3D capabilities. For asset creation, we'll master Meshy AI for 3D models, Suno.ai for music, and ElevenLabs for sound effects.

**[ON SCREEN: Programming tools section]**

For AI-assisted programming, we'll use Cursor.ai and Cline—powerful coding assistants that can help you write game code even if you've never programmed before. We'll also set up Ollama for local AI development, giving you privacy and cost control.

**[ON SCREEN: Game engines section]**

We'll work with both Godot—a free, open-source engine perfect for learning—and Unity, the industry standard used by millions of developers worldwide.

**[ON SCREEN: Cost breakdown chart]**

Here's the best part: most of these tools offer free tiers or are completely open-source. You can complete this entire course for less than $20, and many students will spend nothing at all.

**[ON SCREEN: Learning path diagram]**

Our learning path is designed to build your skills progressively. We start with simple AI-native platforms to build confidence, then gradually introduce more sophisticated tools and techniques. By the end of the course, you'll be comfortable with the entire AI-assisted game development pipeline.

### [19:00-21:00] First Hands-on Experience

**[ON SCREEN: Rosebud AI interface, ready for demonstration]**

**NARRATOR**: Let's get you started with your first AI game creation experience. I want you to follow along as I demonstrate the basic workflow in Rosebud AI.

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Step-by-step game creation]**

First, we'll create an account—it's free and takes just a minute. Now, let's create something fun. I'm going to make a space exploration game where you pilot a ship through asteroid fields.

**[ON SCREEN: Typing prompt in real-time]**

I'll type: "Create a space exploration game where the player pilots a spaceship through dangerous asteroid fields, collecting fuel pods to stay alive. Include particle effects for the ship's engines and explosion effects when hitting asteroids."

**[ON SCREEN: AI generation process visualization]**

Watch as the AI interprets our prompt and generates the game elements. It's creating the spaceship sprite, asteroid graphics, particle systems, collision detection, and game logic—all from our natural language description.

**[ON SCREEN: Playing the generated game]**

And here's our game! Notice how the AI understood not just what we wanted, but how these elements should work together. The ship moves smoothly, asteroids spawn randomly, and the fuel collection mechanic creates engaging gameplay.

### [21:00-22:00] Summary & Next Steps

**[ON SCREEN: Key takeaways slide]**

## Lecture 2: "Prompt Engineering and AI Collaboration"
**Duration**: 22 minutes  
**Week 2 Foundation**

### [0:00-2:00] Introduction & Objectives

**[ON SCREEN: Lecture title with examples of good vs poor AI outputs]**

**NARRATOR**: Welcome back to AI & Games. Last week, you experienced the magic of creating games with AI for the first time. But you probably also discovered something important: not all AI outputs are created equal.

**[ON SCREEN: Side-by-side comparison of a basic vs sophisticated AI-generated game]**

The difference between a basic AI-generated game and a sophisticated, engaging one often comes down to a single skill: prompt engineering. This is the art and science of communicating effectively with AI systems to get exactly what you envision.

**[ON SCREEN: Learning objectives for this lecture]**

Today, you'll master the fundamentals of prompt engineering for game development, learn to think of AI as a creative collaborator rather than a magic wand, and discover how to build effective human-AI workflows that amplify your creativity.

**[ON SCREEN: Transition to prompt engineering examples]**

By the end of this lecture, you'll be able to craft prompts that consistently generate high-quality game content and understand how to iterate and refine AI outputs to match your creative vision.

### [2:00-9:00] The Science of Prompt Engineering

**[ON SCREEN: Split screen showing vague vs specific prompts and their outputs]**

**NARRATOR**: Let's start with a fundamental truth: AI systems are incredibly powerful, but they're not mind readers. The quality of your output is directly proportional to the quality of your input.

**[ON SCREEN: Example of a vague prompt]**

Consider this prompt: "Make a game about fighting." The AI has to make countless assumptions. What kind of fighting? What setting? What art style? What's the objective?

**[ON SCREEN: Show the generic output from this vague prompt]**

As you can see, we get a very generic result. Now let's try a more specific approach.

**[ON SCREEN: Example of a detailed prompt]**

"Create a 2D side-scrolling fighting game set in a cyberpunk city. The player controls a ninja with electric powers fighting against robot enemies. Use a dark color palette with neon highlights. Include wall-jumping mechanics and combo attacks with visual effects."

**[ON SCREEN: Show the much more sophisticated output]**

Notice the dramatic difference. The AI now has clear direction for every aspect of the game: genre, setting, character abilities, visual style, and core mechanics.

**[ON SCREEN: Prompt engineering framework diagram]**

Effective prompt engineering follows a framework I call SPACE: Setting, Player, Actions, Challenge, and Experience. Let's break this down.

**[ON SCREEN: Each element highlighted with examples]**

Setting defines your game world—is it medieval fantasy, modern day, or distant future? Player describes who the player controls and their abilities. Actions specify what the player can do—jump, shoot, cast spells. Challenge outlines the obstacles and objectives. Experience describes the emotional tone and visual style.

**[ON SCREEN: Live demonstration of building a prompt using SPACE framework]**

Let me demonstrate this framework in action. I want to create a puzzle game, so I'll build my prompt systematically:

Setting: "A mysterious ancient library filled with magical books"
Player: "A young apprentice wizard who can manipulate light and shadow"
Actions: "Solve puzzles by redirecting light beams using mirrors and crystals"
Challenge: "Navigate increasingly complex light puzzles to unlock forbidden knowledge"
Experience: "Atmospheric and contemplative with warm lighting and mystical sound effects"

**[ON SCREEN: Combining these elements into a complete prompt]**

Now I'll combine these elements: "Create a puzzle game set in a mysterious ancient library filled with magical books. The player controls a young apprentice wizard who can manipulate light and shadow to solve puzzles by redirecting light beams using mirrors and crystals. The goal is to navigate increasingly complex light puzzles to unlock forbidden knowledge. The game should feel atmospheric and contemplative with warm lighting and mystical sound effects."

### [9:00-15:00] AI as Creative Collaborator

**[ON SCREEN: Traditional creative process vs AI-collaborative process]**

**NARRATOR**: One of the biggest mindset shifts in AI-assisted development is learning to think of AI as a creative collaborator rather than a tool that simply executes commands.

**[ON SCREEN: Diagram showing iterative collaboration cycle]**

Traditional development is often linear: you have an idea, you implement it, you're done. AI collaboration is iterative: you propose an idea, the AI offers variations and interpretations, you refine and redirect, and together you discover possibilities neither of you would have found alone.

**[ON SCREEN: Live demonstration of iterative prompt refinement]**

Let me show you this collaborative process in action. I'll start with a basic concept and let the AI help me evolve it.

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Real-time prompt iteration in Rosebud AI]**

Initial prompt: "Create a racing game with unusual vehicles."

**[ON SCREEN: Show first AI output]**

Interesting! The AI created a game with flying carpets. I didn't expect that, but it's intriguing. Let me build on this unexpected direction.

Refined prompt: "Expand the flying carpet racing game to include magical power-ups like speed boosts from phoenix feathers and shield spells from dragon scales. Add floating islands as the race track."

**[ON SCREEN: Show evolved output]**

Now we're getting somewhere unique! The AI took my basic concept and helped me discover a magical racing game I never would have conceived on my own. This is the power of true collaboration.

**[ON SCREEN: Examples of AI suggesting unexpected creative directions]**

AI systems often make connections that humans miss. They might suggest combining genres in unexpected ways, propose visual styles you hadn't considered, or offer gameplay mechanics that solve problems you didn't know you had.

**[ON SCREEN: Framework for effective AI collaboration]**

Here's my framework for effective AI collaboration: Start broad, embrace surprises, build on AI suggestions, and always maintain creative control. The AI is your brainstorming partner, not your replacement.

### [15:00-19:00] Narrative Generation Deep Dive

**[ON SCREEN: Transition to narrative tools interface]**

**NARRATOR**: Now let's explore one of AI's most powerful applications in game development: narrative generation. Modern AI can create compelling characters, engaging dialogue, and complex storylines that adapt to player choices.

**[ON SCREEN: Demonstration of AI Dungeon interface]**

AI Dungeon pioneered AI-generated interactive storytelling. Let me show you how to use it for game narrative development.

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Creating a game narrative in AI Dungeon]**

I'll start with a scenario prompt: "You are a detective in a noir-style city investigating mysterious disappearances linked to an underground tech corporation. The city is perpetually shrouded in rain and neon lights."

**[ON SCREEN: AI generating story content in real-time]**

Watch as the AI builds this world. It's creating atmospheric descriptions, introducing characters with distinct personalities, and establishing plot hooks that could drive an entire game's narrative.

**[ON SCREEN: Transition to ChatGPT for structured narrative development]**

For more structured narrative development, ChatGPT excels at creating character backstories, dialogue trees, and quest structures.

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Using ChatGPT for game narrative elements]**

Let me ask it to create a character profile: "Create a detailed character profile for the antagonist in my cyberpunk detective game. Include their motivation, background, and how they connect to the missing persons case."

**[ON SCREEN: Rich character profile generated by AI]**

Look at this detailed character profile! The AI created a complex antagonist with clear motivations, a compelling backstory, and specific connections to our game's central mystery. This level of detail would typically take hours to develop manually.

**[ON SCREEN: Branching dialogue tree example]**

AI can also generate branching dialogue trees. I'll ask for a conversation between our detective and a key witness, with multiple player response options that affect the story's direction.

### [19:00-21:00] Building Effective Workflows

**[ON SCREEN: Workflow diagram showing human-AI collaboration process]**

**NARRATOR**: Successful AI collaboration requires establishing effective workflows that leverage both human creativity and AI capabilities.

**[ON SCREEN: Step-by-step workflow visualization]**

Here's the workflow I recommend: First, define your creative vision clearly. What's the core experience you want to create? Second, craft specific prompts using frameworks like SPACE. Third, generate multiple variations and options. Fourth, curate and combine the best elements. Finally, iterate and refine based on testing and feedback.

**[ON SCREEN: Example of workflow in practice]**

Let me demonstrate this workflow by developing a complete game concept from scratch.

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Complete workflow demonstration]**

Vision: I want to create a cozy farming game with a magical twist.

Prompt: "Create a farming simulation game where players grow magical plants that have special properties. Set in a whimsical valley where seasons affect magic. Players can craft potions from their magical crops and trade with fairy merchants."

**[ON SCREEN: Multiple AI outputs and curation process]**

I'll generate several variations, then curate the best elements from each. The AI suggested some wonderful ideas I hadn't considered: plants that glow during certain moon phases, seasonal festivals that boost magical properties, and a friendship system with woodland creatures.

### [21:00-22:00] Summary & Next Steps

**[ON SCREEN: Key principles of prompt engineering]**

**NARRATOR**: Today, you've learned that effective prompt engineering is about clear communication, creative collaboration, and iterative refinement. Remember the SPACE framework: Setting, Player, Actions, Challenge, and Experience.

**[ON SCREEN: Assignment preview]**

Your assignment this week is to develop a complete game design document using AI assistance. Choose a game concept and use the tools we've discussed to create detailed character profiles, narrative outlines, and gameplay descriptions.

**[ON SCREEN: Next lecture preview]**

Next week, we'll shift our focus to visual asset creation. You'll learn to generate professional-quality 2D art, create consistent visual styles, and integrate AI-generated assets into your games.

**[ON SCREEN: Community engagement reminder]**

Don't forget to share your narrative experiments in our Discord community. The stories and characters you create this week will become the foundation for the visual assets we'll generate next.

**[ON SCREEN: Closing slide]**

Remember: AI is not replacing your creativity—it's amplifying it. The best AI-assisted games come from developers who master the art of human-AI collaboration. See you next week!
