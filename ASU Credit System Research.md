# ASU Credit System Research

## Key Findings

### Credit Hour Requirements (Arizona Board of Regents - ABOR)
- **1 credit hour = 45 total hours** of student work
- This includes all learning activities: reading, watching videos, studying, completing assignments
- Coursework time commitment varies by course length:
  - 6 weeks: 7.5 hours per week
  - 7.5 weeks: 6 hours per week  
  - 8 weeks: 5.6 hours per week
  - 15 weeks: 3 hours per week

### Course Structure Options
- ASU courses range from 6 weeks to 15 weeks in length
- For a 1-credit AI & Games course, students should expect 45 total hours of engagement
- This could be structured as:
  - 8-week course: ~5.6 hours per week
  - 15-week semester: ~3 hours per week

### Implications for AI & Games Course
- 45 hours is sufficient for a focused, hands-on course
- Time should be allocated across: learning AI tools, practical application, project development
- Course should be intensive but manageable within the credit framework
