## Video 1: Course Welcome & Overview (15 minutes)

### [0:00-2:00] Opening & Welcome

**[INSTRUCTOR ON CAMERA - Enthusiastic, welcoming tone]**

"Welcome to AI & Games - the course that will transform how you think about game development! I'm [Instructor Name], and I'm absolutely thrilled you've decided to join us on this incredible journey.

Over the next seven weeks, you're going to discover something revolutionary: how artificial intelligence can become your most powerful creative partner in game development. Whether you're a complete beginner who's never written a line of code, or an experienced developer curious about AI, this course will change everything you thought you knew about making games.

**[SCREEN SHARE: Course website homepage]**

Let me show you exactly what we're going to accomplish together. In just 45 hours - that's 3 hours of live sessions plus 42 hours of hands-on practice - you'll master over 15 cutting-edge AI tools and create a complete portfolio of professional-quality games."

### [2:00-5:00] The AI Revolution in Gaming

**[SCREEN SHARE: Industry statistics and examples]**

"Before we dive into what you'll learn, let's talk about why this matters RIGHT NOW. The gaming industry is experiencing the biggest transformation since the shift from 2D to 3D graphics.

**[SHOW SLIDE: Industry Impact Statistics]**

- 60-70% of studio budgets traditionally go to art creation - we'll show you how to do this in minutes, not months
- Development cycles that used to take 18 months are now being compressed to weeks
- 100% of major studios are integrating AI into their pipelines

**[SHOW EXAMPLES: Before/After AI game development]**

But here's what's really exciting - AI isn't just making existing processes faster. It's democratizing game development. For the first time in history, a single person with the right knowledge can create games that would have required entire teams just two years ago.

**[PERSONAL STORY - Adjust to instructor's experience]**

I've been in game development for [X years], and I've never seen anything like this. Last month, I watched a student with zero programming experience create a fully playable puzzle game in 3 hours using the techniques we'll teach you. That's not the exception - that's becoming the norm."

### [5:00-8:00] Course Structure & Philosophy

**[SCREEN SHARE: Course curriculum overview]**

"Our approach is different from traditional game development courses. We're not just teaching you tools - we're teaching you to think like a creative director of your own AI-powered development team.

**[SHOW WEEKLY BREAKDOWN]**

Each week builds systematically:
- Week 1: AI landscape and your first AI-generated game
- Week 2: Visual asset creation and art direction
- Week 3: Audio design and music composition
- Week 4: AI-assisted programming
- Week 5: Workflow optimization
- Week 6: Advanced AI integration
- Week 7: Portfolio development and career preparation

**[EMPHASIZE KEY PHILOSOPHY]**

Our core philosophy is simple: AI doesn't replace creativity - it amplifies it. You'll learn to be the creative visionary while AI handles the technical execution. Think of it as having a team of specialists at your fingertips, ready to bring your ideas to life instantly."

### [8:00-12:00] What Makes This Course Unique
